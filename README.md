this is the submodule

Technical Decisions:

Firebase was used for the authetication and the database, and this decision was taken because of the time limit, and because no database was given to me.

I used Flutterwave as the payment service provider because
1: They are one of the payment service provider in nigeria
2: There SDK is up to date and fast

I consumed exchargeRate api to convert the currencies.

I used MVVM as the architecture of the app.
